New Features Explained:
Transition to New Technology:

A button labeled "Transition to New Technology" resets the S-curve, simulating the introduction of a new technology.
The function transitionTechnology() simply reinitializes the S-curve to a default state.
Revenue and Customer Satisfaction Sliders:

Two new sliders control Customer Satisfaction and Revenue Growth. The values from these sliders directly influence the revenue graph.
The function generateRevenueData() simulates revenue growth based on these inputs.
Competitor Pressure:

The Competitor Pressure slider continues to impact the transition point of the S-curve, simulating how competitive actions force earlier adoption of new technologies.
Additional Chart for Revenue:

A new line chart using Chart.js displays revenue growth. It simulates how revenue fluctuates based on customer satisfaction and growth rate.
The updateRevenue() function updates the chart dynamically as the sliders are adjusted.
How It Works:
Adjust the R&D Investment, Marketing Spend, Price Sensitivity, Competitor Pressure, Customer Satisfaction, and Revenue Growth sliders to observe changes in the two line graphs:

Adoption Rate (%) (S-Curve): Shows how adoption changes over time based on the inputs.
Revenue ($): Displays how revenue increases or fluctuates based on customer satisfaction and revenue growth.
The "Transition to New Technology" button resets the S-curve, simulating the lifecycle of a new product or technology being introduced.

This enhanced simulation now provides a more complete model of how companies can optimize product development and introduction strategies while balancing customer satisfaction, revenue growth, and competitor pressure.
